# -Full_Stack_Dev_beginner

<h1>First Step</h1>
<p>We started by adding the tools we will use in the process of learning full stack development.</p>
<p>We installed VS Code and Node.js then by a command in the command line, we added Browser Sync. This tool played an important role in our projet since it lets us see changes in our website instantly.</p>
